Hello there, I'm Spencer Howlett.
I'm interested in machine learning in all of it's applications. I want to continue to hone my skills and work on my own personal project. Over the last 2 years 
I've worked on my own stock prediction system built off of Tensorflow and Scikit-learn. I'm currently finishing my last semeseter of college at Colorado State 
University and am looking to get my first industry job.
